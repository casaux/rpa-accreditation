			<p>If you’re near a helicopter landing site or non-controlled aerodrome, you can fly your drone within 5.5km — but only if manned aircraft are not operating in the area and you’re not within the boundary of the airfield or in the approach or departure paths. If you do become aware of manned aircraft nearby, you will have to manoeuvre away and land your drone as quickly and safely as possible.</p>
